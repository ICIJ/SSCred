# SSCred

A python library to facilitate anonymous authentication. SSCred providers following primitives:

* Anonymous credential light<sup>[1](#cn1)</sup>
* Abe's Blind signature<sup>[2](#cn2)</sup>
* Blinded Pedersen commitment

## Requirement
SSCred depends on the `petlib` library. Before installing the library make sure that  `libssl-dev`, `python-dev`, and `libffi-dev` packages are installed on your machine. You can use following commands on Ubuntu/Debian to install them.

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

## Installing
You can use `pip` to install the library.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/spring-epfl/SSCred
```

You can use `pytest` to test the installation

```
python -m pytest
```

### Development
If you are interested in contributing to this library, you can clone the code and
install the library in the development mode.

```
git clone https://github.com/spring-epfl/SSCred
cd SSCred
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m pytest
```

##  Usage
### ACL
Provides an one-time-use anonymous credential based on ACL<sup>[1](#cn1)</sup>. The user decides on a list of attributes and a message and engages in an interactive protocol with the issuer. The issuer cannot observe the content of attributes or the message. At the end of the protocol, the user computes a credential. 
At a later time, users can show the credential to a verifier to authorize their attributes and the message. This credential is publicly verifiable and anyone who knows knows the issuer public key can check it. This credential is not linked to the user identity. However, the user cannot use this credential more than once without linking credential uses. In other words, if the user uses the credential more than once, then the credential becomes a pseudo-identity for the user. The library raises an exception if the user tries to use a credential more than once.

The user can embed a public key in attributes to be able to sign with the credential after receiving it.

  How to use:
```python
>>> # generating keys and wrappers 
>>> issuer_priv, issuer_pk = ACLParam().generate_new_key_pair() 
>>> issuer = ACLIssuer(issuer_priv, issuer_pk) 
>>> user = ACLUser(issuer_pk) 
>>> message = "Hello world"

>>> # Issuance
>>> attributes = [Bn(13), "Hello", "WoRlD", "Hidden"]
>>> attr_proof = user.prove_attr_knowledge(attributes)
>>> com = issuer.commit(attr_proof)
>>> challenge = user.compute_blind_challenge(com, message)
>>> resp = issuer.respond(challenge)
>>> cred_private = user.compute_credential(resp)

>>> # show credential
>>> cred = cred_private.show_credential([True, True, True, False])
>>> assert cred.verify_credential(issuer_pk)
>>> print(cred.get_message())
b'Hello world'
>>> print(cred.get_attributes())
[13, 'Hello', 'WoRlD', None]
```

### Blind signature
The user decides on a message and engages in an interactive protocol with the signer to compute a signature on the message. This protocol prevents the signer from learning the content of the message. The signature is verifiable by anyone who knows the signer's public key. No one, including the signer, can determine the user's identity when he reveals his signature. This signature is based on Abe's blind signature<sup>[2](#cn2)</sup>.

  How to use:
```python
>>> # generating keys and wrappers
>>> priv, pk = AbeParam().generate_new_key_pair()
>>> signer = AbeSigner(priv, pk)
>>> user = AbeUser(pk)
>>> message = "Hello world"
>>> # Interactive signing
>>> com = signer.commit()
>>> challenge = user.compute_blind_challenge(com, message)
>>> resp = signer.respond(challenge)
>>> sig = user.compute_signature(resp)
>>> # Verifying the signature
>>> assert pk.verify_signature(sig)
>>> print(sig.message)
b'Hello world'
```

### Blinded Pedersen Commitment
This scheme allows a party to prove the knowledge of a commitment without revealing any information about underlying values or the commitment itself. This primitive is mainly intended as a building block for more complicated primitives rather than direct use. 

  How to use:
```python
>>> values = [Bn(123), Bn(456), 'hello', b"world"]
>>> param = BlindedPedersenParam(hs_size=len(values))
>>> # reveal nothing
>>> bcommit, bpriv = param.blind_commit(values)
>>> bproof = bcommit.prove_values(bpriv)
>>> assert bcommit.verify_proof(param, bproof)
>>> # revealing some values
>>> bproof = bcommit.prove_values(bpriv, reveal_mask=[True, False, True, True])
>>> assert bcommit.verify_proof(param, bproof)
>>> print(bproof.revealed_values)
[123, None, 'hello', b'world']  
```

## Performance
### Abe's signature
We used the `benchmark.py` to evaluate the performance:

| Curve | Key gen (ms) | Signer (ms) | User  (ms) | Verification (ms) | Signature size (B) | Communication (B) |
|-------|:------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| P-224 |         0.84 |        1.13 |       1.63 |              0.68 |                324 |               367 |
| P-256 |         0.13 |        0.32 |       0.62 |              0.4  |                360 |               413 |
